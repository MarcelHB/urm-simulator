URM and TM simulation
======================

**Currently under experimental development! C code: lots of TODOs, no clean ups, no proper interfaces so far.**

Tiny toolset to provide simulators for Unlimited Register Machines (URMs) and Turing Machines (TMs). 

Wish list:

* URM, TM
* different flavors of program types
* Ruby, C and C-JIT backended


Primarily written for personal experience and verification.
